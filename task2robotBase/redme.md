In this document, I made a robot flow control page so that a value is stored when the button is pressed and it is printed in a concole.

I used html, js, PHP codes to perform this task, and I created a sql database to store the values ??and made sure that it worked as required.

I used html,css codes to make and format the interface, php to insert and update the database, and js to prevent redirecting from the control page..

I also used some open source code and modified it to meet the requirements.
