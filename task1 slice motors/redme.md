This folder contains the files of the first task robot arm motors.

The first file is index.html and contains the interface codes with their format,

, and the second file is motors.php contains the php code, which is concerned with linking the interface page(html) with the sql database

I used some ready-made code from w3school and modified it to suit the requirements of the project

I added a slider for each motor, a run button and a save button, and I created the database on localhost to save the changes and made sure the project was working properly.
